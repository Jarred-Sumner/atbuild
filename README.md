# AtBuild â€“ JavaScript Preprocessor

AtBuild is a JavaScript preprocessor. It lets you write JavaScript that writes JavaScript.

Use it for:

- Easy, editable code generation
- Write high-performance JavaScript libraries by removing the runtime
- Determinstic dead code elimination
- Move slow code from runtime to buildtime

# How it works

AtBuild has two rules:

1. Any line that starts with `@` will be evaluated at buildtime instead of runtime.

2. Any line containing `@{codeInHere}` will be evaluated at buildtime instead of runtime.

You write some of your JavaScript in `.@js` files, and by default, all the code in the file will be evaluated at runtime.

But, if the line starts with an `@` or if it contains `@{}`, those parts of the file will be switched out, and run at build-time instead.

The code evaluated at buildtime is also JavaScript.

## Contrived example:

```js
// hello-world.@js
@var hi = 0;

@for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Hello World @{i}");
  @hi++;
@}

module.exports = @{hi};
```

After we run it through `atbuild ./hello-world.@js`, it becomes:

```js
// hello-world.js

console.log("Hello World 0");
console.log("Hello World 1");
console.log("Hello World 2");
console.log("Hello World 3");
console.log("Hello World 4");

module.exports = 5;
```

## Why?

Extremely fast native languages like Rust & C often use [inline expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion) and [loop unrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling) to move work from runtime to buildtime. For code that doesn't change much, this can be a massive performance improvement.

Unfortunately, since JavaScript is a dynamic language, that's not natively supported. High performance JavaScript libraries like [ndarray](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray) and [Kiwi](https://github.com/evanw/kiwi) resort to [writing code inside code](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray/blob/master/ndarray.js#L123) by [adding strings together](https://github.com/evanw/kiwi/blob/1a82ea6592ff25f26e35ca69e58c98852072eae9/js/js.ts#L11), which is hard for humans to read whats going on.

Nowadays, much of the JavaScript we write is already behind [seven](https://webpack.js.org/) [different](https://babeljs.io/) [compilers](https://v8.dev/docs/turbofan), so why not add another?

### What can I use this for?

I wrote AtBuild because I needed to improve the performance for some parts of a game I'm building.

But, here are some other ways you could use this:

- Zero-runtime SQL ORM. Instead of a general-purpose SQL query builder evaluated at runtime (what Sequelize and every other JavaScript SQL ORM does), a SQL ORM built with AtBuild could compile down to a handful of functions that format the specific SQL strings used in the application, while being just as easy to use as Sequelize. You'd get the performance of hand-rolling your SQL, with the developer experience of a SQL ORM.
- Edit autogenerated code for calling API endpoints. If you use something like [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) and you want to edit the generated code, you often end up writing wrappers for the generated code. Wouldn't it be better if you could just edit the generated code instead?
- Preprocessing data ahead of time, so that it only is sent once instead of re-evaluated at runtime
- Server-side rendering. Theoretically, you could use this for server-side rendering. AtBuild is a lot like [EJS](https://ejs.co/) but with different syntax.

How is this different than [Prepack](https://prepack.io/)?

Like AtBuild, Prepack inlines & prevaluates code. But, AtBuild lets you choose what code runs at runtime and what code runs at build-time, and use that to generate code. Loops that conditionally add or remove runtime code are not possible with Prepack or with [`babel-plugin-codegen`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-codegen).

# Installation

With yarn:

```bash
yarn add atbuild
```

npm:

```bash
npm install atbuild
```

## CLI

`atbuild` has a small CLI you can use.

```bash
atbuild ./input.@js
```

```bash
atbuild ./input.@js ./output.js
```

```bash
atbuild ./input.@js ./output.js --pretty --no-header
```

## Webpack Loader

**The recommended way to use AtBuild is through the Webpack loader**. This configures Webpack to run any file that ends in `.@js` through AtBuild automatically.

```
// Webpack config
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    // ...
    rules: [
      // ...

       // AtBuild.js Webpack Loader
      {
        // File extension is .@js
        test: /\.@js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        type: "javascript/auto",
        use: [
          {
            loader: "atbuild/dist/webpack-loader
          },
          // Run Babel afterwards
          {
            loader: "babel-loader",
            options: {/* your babel options in here if relevant */},
          },
        ]
      },
    ],
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Next.js integration

This will be cleaned up & moved into a plugin eventually (such as `next-with-atbuild`), however this is how I currently use AtBuild with Next.js:

```js
// Figure out where next-babel-loader is hiding
const nextBabelLoaderContainer = config.module.rules.find((rule) => {
  return (
    (rule.use && rule.use.loader && rule.use.loader === "next-babel-loader") ||
    (rule.use &&
      rule.use.find((loader) => loader.loader === "next-babel-loader"))
  );
});

if (nextBabelLoaderContainer) {
  let loader;

  if (nextBabelLoaderContainer.use.loader === "next-babel-loader") {
    loader = nextBabelLoaderContainer.use;
  } else {
    loader = nextBabelLoaderContainer.use.find(
      (loader) => loader.loader === "next-babel-loader"
    );
  }

  config.module.rules.unshift({
    test: /\.@js$/,
    use: [
      // Pass the loader in before atbuild, so that atbuild runs first.g
      loader,
      {
        // This is where the webpack loader is added.
        loader: "atbuild/dist/webpack-loader",
      },
    ],
  });
} else {
  // Feel free to open an issue if you see this warning.
  console.warn("Unable to activate AtBuild");
}
```

The important thing to note that is that you still want to run Babel on the output from AtBuild. That way, you can still write your code like any other part of your app.

## Alternatives

- [`babel-plugin-codegen`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-codegen) makes it easy to run build scripts, but it gets tough if you want to do some things at build-time and some other things at run-time for the same code.
